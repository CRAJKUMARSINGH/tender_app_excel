AI Agent Prompt for App Development and Optimization
Objective
Analyze an existing application for bugs, ensure functional accuracy, optimize for deployment on Vercel or Streamlit, and suggest enhancements for efficiency and performance.
Tasks
1. Bug Detection and Functional Accuracy

Analyze Codebase: Thoroughly review the application's source code to identify bugs, errors, or inconsistencies.
Test Functionality: Verify that all features work as intended, including user inputs, outputs, and edge cases.
Check Compatibility: Ensure the app functions correctly across target environments (e.g., browsers for Vercel or Python-based environments for Streamlit).
Debugging: Provide fixes for identified bugs, including code snippets and explanations.
Validation: Confirm functional accuracy by testing against expected outcomes and user requirements.

2. Deployment Optimization

Vercel Deployment (if applicable):
Ensure the app uses a compatible framework (e.g., Next.js, React, or static sites).
Optimize build configurations (e.g., vercel.json for routing, environment variables).
Minimize bundle size by removing unused dependencies and optimizing assets.
Enable serverless functions or API routes for dynamic features.
Verify compatibility with Vercel's edge network for fast content delivery.


Streamlit Deployment (if applicable):
Confirm the app is written in Python and uses Streamlit-compatible libraries.
Optimize requirements.txt for minimal dependencies and faster builds.
Ensure proper configuration for Streamlit Cloud (e.g., Procfile, environment settings).
Test for performance issues in data processing or visualization components.
Suggest caching strategies (e.g., st.cache_data or st.cache_resource) for efficiency.



3. Performance and Efficiency Improvements

Code Optimization: Identify and refactor inefficient code (e.g., redundant loops, heavy computations).
Load Time: Reduce initial load time by optimizing assets, lazy-loading resources, or using CDN.
Scalability: Ensure the app handles increased user load or data volume effectively.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to prevent crashes and improve user experience.
Testing: Recommend unit tests, integration tests, or CI/CD pipelines for ongoing reliability.

4. Feature Suggestions

Efficiency Features:
Add caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data.
Implement lazy loading for large datasets or media.
Use WebSockets or real-time APIs for dynamic updates (if applicable).


User Experience:
Suggest UI/UX improvements, such as responsive design or accessibility features.
Add loading spinners or progress bars for long-running processes.


Advanced Features:
Integrate analytics (e.g., Google Analytics for Vercel, custom logging for Streamlit).
Add authentication (e.g., NextAuth.js for Vercel or OAuth for Streamlit).
Propose AI-driven features, such as predictive inputs or automated insights, if relevant.


Performance Enhancements:
Recommend server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG) for Vercel apps.
Suggest multiprocessing or async I/O for Streamlit apps with heavy computations.



Deliverables

A detailed report listing identified bugs, fixes, and functional validation results.
Optimized codebase with deployment configurations for Vercel or Streamlit.
Documentation for deployment steps and environment setup.
A list of suggested features with implementation details and benefits.

Constraints

Ensure compatibility with Vercel or Streamlit deployment platforms.
Avoid external dependencies that are not supported by the target platform.
Prioritize lightweight, efficient solutions for faster performance.
Maintain or enhance the appâ€™s existing functionality unless explicitly requested to change.

Output Format

Provide code changes in diff format or full files wrapped in <xaiArtifact> tags.
Include a markdown report summarizing bugs, fixes, optimizations, and feature suggestions.
Specify deployment instructions for Vercel or Streamlit.
Suggest tools or libraries only if they are open-source and compatible with the target platform.
